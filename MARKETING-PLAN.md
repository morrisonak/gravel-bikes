- **Sign-up:** Join Awin first, then search "Canyon" in merchant directory
- **Commission rate:** 3-5% on bikes, potentially higher on accessories
- **Cookie duration:** 30 days

### DT Swiss
- **Affiliate program:** Limited direct affiliate program
- **Sign-up:** Contact via https://www.dtswiss.com → "Contact" → inquire about partnerships

### Reddit Strategy (Detailed)

**Account Building (Week 1-4):**
1. Create a personal Reddit account (NOT branded as GravelRig)
2. Subscribe to: r/gravelcycling, r/whichbike, r/bikewrench, r/cycling, r/bicycling
3. Comment helpfully on 3-5 posts per day for 2 weeks before sharing any links
4. Build to 500+ karma before posting your own content

**Content Sharing Rules:**
- Reddit's self-promotion limit: no more than 10% of your posts should be your own links
- Always frame links as genuinely helpful: "I wrote a detailed comparison that might help — [link]"
- Never post the same link to multiple subreddits
- Engage with every comment on your posts
- Best posting times: Tuesday-Thursday, 8-10am EST

**Subreddit-Specific Tactics:**
- **r/gravelcycling** (130k+ members): Share ride photos with gear mentions. Post "what's your tire pressure setup?" discussion starters. Link to guides only in comments when asked.
- **r/whichbike** (100k+ members): Answer "which gravel bike should I buy" posts with detailed personalized advice. Link to your roundup as supplementary reading.
- **r/bikewrench** (300k+ members): Answer maintenance questions. Link to your tubeless setup guide when relevant.

- **Link in bio:** Use Linktree (free) or a custom /links page pointing to latest articles
- **Profile pic:** GravelRig logo on dirt/gravel background
- **Highlights:** "Best Bikes" / "Gear" / "Routes" / "Deals"

### 20 Hashtags (rotate in groups of 10-15)

**Primary (use always, 8 tags):**
`#gravelcycling` `#gravelbike` `#gravelride` `#gravelgrinder` `#ridegravel` `#gravelbikes` `#gravellife` `#graveladventure`

**Secondary (rotate, pick 5-7):**
`#bikepackinglife` `#gravel` `#cyclinglife` `#outsideisfree` `#fromwhereiride` `#velogram` `#cyclistlife` `#bikelife` `#dropitstopsit` `#ridealltheroads` `#mixedsurface` `#groadbike`

### Posting Cadence
- **Feed posts:** 3/week (Mon, Wed, Fri at 7am or 6pm CST)
- **Stories:** Daily (ride clips, quick gear takes, polls)
- **Reels:** 2/week — short-form video performs best on IG

### Content Types
1. **Carousel posts** (highest engagement): 5-8 slides summarizing a review/comparison
2. **Single photo** with strong caption: Bike beauty shots on gravel with quick take
3. **Reels:** 30-60 second gear tips, ride clips, "3 things to know about [bike]"

### Reels Strategy
- Hook in first 1.5 seconds: "Don't buy a gravel bike until you watch this"
- Show the product being USED, not just beauty shots
- Text overlays for silent viewing
- End with CTA: "Full review at link in bio"

---

## YouTube (@GravelRig)

### Channel Setup
- **Channel name:** GravelRig
- **Channel description:** "Real gravel bike reviews from real riders. We test on Kansas flint hills, Ozark singletrack, and Iowa B-roads — not manufacturer press trips. Subscribe for honest reviews, gear comparisons, and gravel riding tips."
- **Channel art:** Gravel road landscape with GravelRig branding
- **Default end screen:** Subscribe button + latest video + best-gravel-bikes playlist

### Video Types (in order of affiliate conversion potential)
1. **"Best [Product Category] 2026"** — Roundup videos convert best (8-15 min)
2. **"[Product A] vs [Product B]"** — Comparison videos get search traffic (10-12 min)
3. **Individual reviews** — Deep dives with riding footage (8-12 min)
4. **How-to/Tutorial** — Tubeless setup, maintenance, etc. (5-8 min)

# 5. CONVERSION OPTIMIZATION

## On-Site Conversion Tactics

### Email Capture Strategy
- **Popup trigger:** Show after 45 seconds on site OR after scrolling 50% of article
- **Offer:** "Get our free Gravel Bike Buyer's Cheat Sheet (PDF) + weekly deals"
- **Copy:**
  - Headline: "Not sure which gravel bike to buy?"
  - Subhead: "Download our free cheat sheet comparing 15 gravel bikes by price, weight, and riding style."
  - CTA button: "Send Me the Cheat Sheet"
- **Exit intent popup:** Different offer — "Wait! Get our deal alerts. We track prices on 50+ gravel bikes and gear."
- **Implementation:** Use Mailchimp's free embedded forms, or ConvertKit's free plan

### Trust Signals to Add
- "Tested on [X]+ miles of real gravel" badge on every review page
- "Updated [Month Year]" prominently displayed
- Testing methodology section (how you rate bikes, what terrain, what conditions)
- Team/About section with real names and riding credentials
- "Why you can trust GravelRig" disclosure box with affiliate transparency

### Price Comparison Approach
- On each bike review, show "Where to Buy" box with 2-3 retailers and current prices
- Format:
  ```
  WHERE TO BUY — Canyon Grail CF SL 8
  ✓ Canyon Direct — $3,499 [LINK]  ← Best Price
  ✓ Competitive Cyclist — $3,499 [LINK]
  ```
- Update prices monthly (or use affiliate network APIs if available)

## Email Marketing Funnel

### Recommended Platform
**Buttondown** (free up to 100 subs) for launch → migrate to **ConvertKit** (free up to 1,000 subs) at scale.
Both support automations, tags, and simple landing pages.

### Welcome Sequence (3 emails)

**Email 1 — Immediate (on signup)**
- Subject: "Your Gravel Bike Cheat Sheet is here 📋"
- Content: Deliver the PDF, introduce GravelRig, set expectations ("you'll hear from us weekly with reviews, deals, and riding tips")
- CTA: "Start with our most popular review: Best Gravel Bikes 2026"

**Email 2 — Day 2**
- Subject: "The #1 mistake new gravel riders make"
- Content: Wrong tire pressure story (personal, engaging). Link to tire pressure guide.
- CTA: "Use our free tire pressure calculator"

**Email 3 — Day 5**
- Subject: "How I picked my gravel bike (and what I'd change)"
- Content: Personal story about your bike selection process. Leads into buyer's guide.
- CTA: "Read our complete buyer's guide"

### Weekly Newsletter
- **Day:** Saturday morning (8am CST)
- **Format:** See template in Section 4
- **Deal Alerts:** When major sales happen (REI Anniversary Sale, Competitive Cyclist seasonal sales, Black Friday), send a dedicated deal email

---

## Retargeting Strategy

### Facebook/Instagram Pixel
- **Setup:** Create a Meta Business account → create a Pixel → add the pixel code to your site's `<head>`
- **For Cloudflare Workers:** Add the pixel via a custom HTML response header or inject it in your worker's HTML template
- **Create audiences:**
  - All visitors (180 days)
  - Visited /best-gravel-bikes (high intent)
  - Visited 3+ pages (engaged users)
- **Retarget with:** Carousel ads showing the specific bikes/gear they viewed
- **Budget:** Start at $5/day, only after you have 1,000+ pixel events

### Google Ads Remarketing
- **Setup:** Create Google Ads account → create remarketing tag → add to site
- **Audience:** All visitors who spent 60+ seconds on site
- **Ad type:** Display ads on cycling/outdoor sites
- **Budget:** $5-10/day
- **Wait until:** Month 3+ with consistent traffic

### Pinterest
- **Lower priority** but worth setting up for lifestyle content
- Create pins for: bike beauty shots, gear flat-lays, route photos
- Link to articles
- Good for long-tail traffic (pins last months/years vs. social posts)

# 7. COMPETITOR ANALYSIS

## 1. Gravel Cyclist (gravelcyclist.com)

**What they do:**
- Run by "JOM" — prolific single-author site with deep gravel focus
- Mostly video-based content (YouTube-first strategy with written summaries)
- Covers: bike tech, product reviews, ride reports, event coverage
- Monetization: YouTube ads + affiliate links (Amazon, direct brand links)

**Strengths:**
- Massive content volume (posts almost daily)
- Strong YouTube presence with personality-driven content
- Long history and domain authority (est. ~2014)
- Covers gravel events/news giving them freshness signals

**Weaknesses to exploit:**
- Written content is thin (often just video embeds with brief summaries)
- No structured comparison content ("A vs B" style)
- No budget-focused roundups (under $1500, under $2000)
- Site design is dated
- **GravelRig opportunity:** Win on written depth, structured comparisons, and budget-focused content

## 2. Bikepacking.com

**What they do:**
- Routes, gear reviews, and community content focused on bikepacking
- Beautiful editorial design and photography
- Membership model ("Bikepacking Collective")
- Strong brand partnerships

**Strengths:**
- Premium editorial quality
- Massive route database
- Loyal community (membership model works)
- Excellent photography

**Weaknesses to exploit:**
- Focused on bikepacking, not gravel racing/performance
- Less "buyer's guide" content — more lifestyle/adventure
- Not budget-focused
- **GravelRig opportunity:** Own the "gravel performance" and "best value" angle they ignore. Target riders who want to race, not just tour.

## 3. CyclingTips / Escape Collective (escapecollective.com)

**What they do:**
- Professional cycling journalism covering all disciplines
- Paid subscription model
- High-quality long-form reviews and analysis

**Strengths:**
- Professional journalism standards
- Deep technical expertise
- Strong brand recognition

**Weaknesses to exploit:**
- Gravel is a small subset of their coverage (road racing dominant)
- Subscription paywall limits discoverability
- Too broad — not gravel-specific
- **GravelRig opportunity:** Be the gravel-ONLY specialist. Deeper coverage of gravel-specific gear, more budget options, more accessible (free) content.

## 4. BikeRadar (bikeradar.com)

**What they do:**
- Massive cycling review/news site (Future Publishing)
- Covers all bikes including gravel
- Huge content library, strong SEO

**Strengths:**
- Enormous domain authority (DA 80+)
- Professional testing facilities
- Comprehensive coverage

**Weaknesses to exploit:**
- Corporate/generic tone — no personality
- UK-focused pricing and availability
- Gravel reviews are one category among dozens — not specialized
- **GravelRig opportunity:** Midwest-authentic voice, US pricing/availability, gravel-obsessive credibility

## 5. The Pro's Closet / TPC (theproscloset.com)

**What they do:**
- Used/certified pre-owned bike retailer with editorial content
- Buyer's guides to drive sales to their inventory

**Weaknesses to exploit:**
- Content exists to sell THEIR inventory, not to be objective
- Limited to what they have in stock
- **GravelRig opportunity:** Genuinely independent recommendations across all retailers

---

## Competitive Gaps GravelRig Should Own

1. **Budget-focused content** — None of the competitors do "best under $X" well
2. **Head-to-head comparisons** — "[Bike A] vs [Bike B]" content is underserved
3. **Midwest/US gravel routes** — Local expertise that big sites can't replicate
4. **Structured, scannable reviews** — Rating systems, spec tables, clear verdicts
5. **Transparent pricing + where-to-buy** — Multi-retailer price comparison boxes
6. **Email-first relationship** — None of the competitors do deal alerts well
